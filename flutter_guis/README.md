# flutter_guis

A Flutter project for executable randomly-placed popups.

To build, go to /flutter_guis and then in terminal, type 'flutter build windows'

Sometimes, the system icon may be wrong. To fix this, you want to replace the icon in /flutter_guis/windows/runner/resources/app_icon.ico with your own, and then run 'flutter clean' before building.

You can change the windows setup for popups in /flutter_guis/windows/runner/main.cpp

The created .exe is in /flutter_guis/build/windows/x64/runner/Release/flutter_guis.exe
